Thanks for contributing! 😁 Here are some rules that will make your example last as long as possible in the constantly changing React ecosystem.

- Go to [Boilerplate-Examples](https://github.com/nomi9995/boilerplate-examples) and fork.
- Go to Specific language directory like `Javascript`
- make your boilerplate there ex: `with-your-example`



If you have doubts about any of these steps, please feel free the reach out to me personally @nomi9995 on Twitter 😁
